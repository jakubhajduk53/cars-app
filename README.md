## General info
There are four main pages: Home, Cars For Sale, Sell Your Car, and Menu.

The Home page displays a button that redirects the client to the Cars For Sale page.

The Cars For Sale page contains a search bar and a list of cars with pagination. Users can check the availability of each posted car.

The Sell Your Car page gives users the opportunity to post their own car offers, but only when they are logged in.

The Menu page is designed for user management. Users can log in, register, and manage their account data, including deleting or updating their posted cars.
